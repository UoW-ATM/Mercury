Overview of Mercury
-------------------

Mercury is an open source mobility simulator designed by and for researchers. It's been built around issues related to
air transportation and it's:

- agent-based driven,
- stochastic,
- event-driven,
- microscopic, down to single flights and passengers,
- encompassing the whole European Airspace and beyond (ECAC),
- modular,
- able to communicate with other models, optimisers, and even HMIs.
